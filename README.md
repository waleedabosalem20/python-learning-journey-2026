# Python Data Experiments

A collection of small Python scripts I wrote while learning programming basics and data cleaning — the foundation for data engineering.

## What I'm Learning
- String manipulation & parsing messy data
- Loops, conditionals, indexing
- Cleaning inconsistent inputs (real-world data is rarely perfect)

## Folders

- **string-parsing**  
  Extracting name, role, age from messy strings (different formats, typos, extra characters)

- **list-processing**  
  Finding missing values (`None`) in lists and reporting positions

## Why This Repo Exists
Started as simple exercises while following Python courses.  
Planning to add more advanced stuff later: pandas cleaning, ETL scripts, API pulls, etc.
